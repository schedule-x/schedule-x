# The modern JavaScript event calendar

Schedule-X is an event calendar focused on covering the needs of modern web apps: responsive design, 
internationalization, and extensibility. You can ship it with default settings in a matter of minutes, or customize
it to look- and work like you want. If you're using a JS-framework, you can even inject components written in your 
own framework, into the UI of the calendar. Currently, there are components for the following frameworks:

[React](https://schedule-x.dev/docs/frameworks/react) | [Angular](https://schedule-x.dev/docs/frameworks/angular) | [Vue](https://schedule-x.dev/docs/frameworks/vue) | [Svelte](https://schedule-x.dev/docs/frameworks/svelte) | [Preact](https://schedule-x.dev/docs/frameworks/preact)
