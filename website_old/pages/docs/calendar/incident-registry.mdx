# Incident with private package registry

On November 9th 2024, a user of Schedule-X premium reported that they were unable to download some older versions
of the premium plugins. After a quick investigation of the DB on the registry server, it turned out that the
versions were **actually** missing. The issue has been reported in the GitHub repository of the open source software
used for the registry: https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/2390.

Since this was a fairly critical issue, and I don't want to risk more similar incidents, I decided to move the registry
to a self-hosted GitLab instance, which is up and running as of November 13th.

This means that all customers of Schedule-X premium will have to update their `.npmrc` file, and add the token that
you will all receive over the email address you used to purchase the premium version. The .npmrc file should now
look as follows:

```bash
@sx-premium:registry=https://gitlab.schedule-x.com/api/v4/packages/npm/
//gitlab.schedule-x.com/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
```

`YOUR_TOKEN` then needs to be replaced with the token you will receive in the email.

The old registry `npm.schedule-x.dev`, with the latest couple of releases still available, will be kept up and running until 1st of January 2025,
and will then be taken out of service.

I apologize for the inconvenience, and will always be committed to try and have zero unwanted downtimes or incidents
of this sort.

Kind greetings,
Tom
