## Reports

Schedule-X takes software quality very seriously. The product is built to be as reliable as possible over time. We
run static code testing with ESlint on every pull request, and additionally dynamically test our applications with:

1) [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) browser testing
2) [Vitest](http://vitest.dev/) for unit testing
