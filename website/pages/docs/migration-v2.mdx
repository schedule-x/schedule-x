# Migration guide for v2

V2 brought a few breaking changes in the UI and internal APIs.

If you haven't built your own custom plugins, you will probably be able to migrate effortlessly.

## Migrating with custom plugins

If you have built custom plugins that use the internal config in some way, you will need to change the
way you access the config values. This is because the config values are now mostly reactive. So for example:

v1.x.x: `$app.config.locale` ➡️ v2.x.x: `$app.config.locale.value`

And this pattern repeats itself across the different config values.

Also, the `init` function on plugins has been renamed into `onRender`, to better reflect when it is invoked. It is
now accompanied by another method for plugins, `beforeRender`.

## Breaking changes in the UI

The UI had a few breaking changes:
- The time grid event now displays a location by default, if one exists on the event. The `showLocation` option has
now been removed.
- Month grid- and date grid events now display a timestamp next to their title, for all timed events.
- The view selection component is now hidden, if there is only one view available.

## `@schedule-x/react`

The `Calendar` alias for the `ScheduleXCalendar` component has been removed. If you were using this API, use `ScheduleXCalendar` instead.
