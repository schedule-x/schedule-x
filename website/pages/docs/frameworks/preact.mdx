# <PreactIcon /> Preact component

This page offers documentation for using the Schedule-X calendar in Preact. For general documentation on
configuring and interacting with the calendar, refer to the rest of the calendar documentation.

## Installing

```bash copy
npm install @schedule-x/preact @schedule-x/theme-default
```

If you're using a package manager that does not automatically
download peer dependencies, you will additionally need to install `@schedule-x/calendar`, `@preact/signals` and
`preact`. This is for example the case for **yarn** and **npm < v7**.

## Basic usage

### Example

```tsx
import { useCalendarApp, ScheduleXCalendar } from '@schedule-x/preact'
import {
  viewWeek,
  viewDay,
  viewMonthGrid,
  viewMonthAgenda,
} from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import { createDragAndDropPlugin } from '@schedule-x/drag-and-drop'

const dragAndDrop = createDragAndDropPlugin()

import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

function CalendarApp() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    defaultView: viewMonthGrid.name,
    views: [viewDay, viewWeek, viewMonthGrid, viewMonthAgenda],
    events: [
      {
        id: '1',
        title: 'Event 1',
        start: '2023-12-16',
        end: '2023-12-16',
      },
    ],
    plugins: [dragAndDrop],
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <ScheduleXCalendar calendarApp={calendar} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default CalendarApp;
```

## Styles

The Schedule-X calendar is a responsive component. To achieve this,
it cannot be delivered with a fixed height or width of its own. You need to define the height and width of the
wrapping element `.sx-preact-calendar-wrapper` according to your needs. For a regular desktop application, something
like this might do the trick for you:

```css
.sx-preact-calendar-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 800px;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
```

## Custom components

The Schedule-X calendar is built with customization in mind. Currently, you can use the following custom
components to take control over certain parts of the calendar. This is done by writing your own Preact components:

| Component name     | Description                                                      | Props                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `timeGridEvent`    | The component for timed events used in the week- and day views   | `calendarEvent`                 |
| `dateGridEvent`    | The component for all-day events used in the week- and day views | `calendarEvent`                 |
| `monthGridEvent`   | The component for events used in the month grid view             | `calendarEvent`, `hasStartDate` |
| `monthAgendaEvent` | The component for events used in the month agenda view           | `calendarEvent`                 |
| `eventModal`       | The component for the event modal                                | `calendarEvent`                 |
