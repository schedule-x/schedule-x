# Background events

Additional to the regular calendar events, you can also add background events. These are thought to be used for
displaying things such as out-of-office hours, public holidays or other events that your users won't interact with or
have the possibility to change.

You can then style these background events to your taste via a `style` property, and add a `title` which will be
added as a title-property to the HTML element for the background event (thus creating a tooltip).

## API

```ts
import { createCalendar, createViewWeek } from '@schedule-x/calendar'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ... other config
  backgroundEvents: [

    // full day event
    {
      title: 'Out of office',
      start: '2024-09-03',
      end: '2024-09-03',
      style: {
        // create tilted 5px thick gray lines
        backgroundImage: 'repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, #ccc, #ccc 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 10px)',
        opacity: 0.5,
      },
    },

    // timed event
    {
      title: 'Out of office',
      start: '2024-09-02 00:00',
      end: '2024-09-02 02:00',
      style: {
        background: 'linear-gradient(45deg, #f91c45, #1c7df9)',
        opacity: 0.5,
      },
    },

    // multi-day event
    {
      title: 'Holiday',
      start: '2024-09-05',
      end: '2024-09-07',
      style: {
        backgroundImage: 'repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, #1cf9b0, #1cf9b0 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 10px)',
        opacity: 0.5,
      },
    }
  ],
})
```
