# Plugins

The calendar can be extended with additional features through plugins. Currently, Schedule-X offers three plugins,
all documented below. You can also [create your own plugin](#write-your-own-plugin).

## Available plugins

### Drag and Drop

Update event time and date using a classical drag and drop. Available in all views except the month agenda view.

#### Install

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/drag-and-drop
```

#### Usage

```js
import { createDragAndDropPlugin } from '@schedule-x/drag-and-drop'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [createDragAndDropPlugin()],
})
```

### Event modal

If your events have more information than just their time and a short title, chances are it would be helpful to
display information about the events in a modal.

#### Install

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/event-modal
```

#### Usage

```js
import { createEventModalPlugin } from '@schedule-x/event-modal'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [createEventModalPlugin()],
})
```

### Scroll controller

Take control over the scrolling in the week- and day view grids.

#### Install

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/scroll-controller
```

#### Usage

```js
import { createScrollControllerPlugin } from '@schedule-x/scroll-controller'

const scrollController = createScrollControllerPlugin({
  initialScroll: '07:50'
})

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [scrollController]
})
calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))

scrollController.scrollTo('04:00')
```

### Resize

Resize events in the time grid by dragging their bottom edge, and fullday/multiple-day events by dragging their right
edge. Month view support is planned as a minor release during the 1.x.x release cycle.

import {Callout} from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡" title="Note">
  Though this plugin should technically work also when using custom components in Vue or React, it might look a bit
  ugly because it forces each custom event to rerender on every resize. This is planned to be fixed with v2.0.0
</Callout>

#### Install

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/resize
```

#### Usage

```js
import { createResizePlugin } from '@schedule-x/resize'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [createResizePlugin()],
})
```

## Write your own plugin

A plugin can be any object that has a `name` property, and an `init` method. The `$app` object, the "control center"
object of the calendar, is then received as the first argument of the `init` method. This gives you access to most
of the calendar's global, internal APIs.

If you're writing TypeScript, the type of this object is
`CalendarAppSingleton`. If you're writing JavaScript, just leave out the type annotation, but then take a moment to
study the following interface and its nested interfaces to get an idea of what's available to you: https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x/blob/main/packages/shared/src/interfaces/calendar/calendar-app-singleton.ts

### A simple example

```ts
import { CalendarAppSingleton } from '@schedule-x/shared'

class LoggerPlugin {
  name = 'logger-plugin'

  init($app: CalendarAppSingleton) {
    $app.calendarEvents.list.value.forEach((event) => {
      console.log('init', event)
    })
  }
}

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [new LoggerPlugin()],
})
```
