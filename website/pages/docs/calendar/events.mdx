# Events

At the center of any calendar, lie the events that are planned into it. An
event can have the following properties:

## Event Properties

| Property      | Type                 | Description                                 | Required |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| `id`          | `string` or `number` | A unique identifier for the event.          | Yes      |
| `start`       |                      | The start time of the event.                | Yes      |
| `end`         |                      | The end time of the event.                  | Yes      |
| `title`       | `string`             | The title of the event.                     | No       |
| `description` | `string`             | A description of the event.                 | No       |
| `location`    | `string`             | The location of the event.                  | No       |
| `people`      | `string[]`           | Names of the participants                   | No       |
| `calendarId`  | `string`             | id of the calendar. See "calendars" section | No       |

## Other properties

Since you may want to add additional properties to your events, that carry meaning in the business logic of your
application, you are free to do so. The calendar will simply ignore the existence of them and return them back to
you upon interacting with the events.

## Event time

The calendar internally distinguishes between a few types of events. The most basic distinction between them, is
whether they are **timed events** or **full day events**.

1. **Timed events** - Events that have a start and end time such as:

```js
const timedEvent = {
  id: 1,
  start: '2025-10-01 20:15',
  end: '2025-10-01 21:15',
}
```

2. **Full day events** - Events that span the entire day such as:

```js
const fullDayEvent = {
  id: 2,
  start: '2025-10-01',
  end: '2025-10-01',
}
```

Furthermore, both of these types then have the possibility to be either a **single day event** or a **multi day event**.

<Callout type="info">
  Though a planned future feature, the calendar does not yet support{' '}
  <b>time zones</b>. All times are assumed to be in the same time zone. If this
  feature is important to you, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub
  repository to help prioritize this feature.

## Interacting with events

The events that you pass to the calendar are considered immutable by the calendar. The calendar instead creates its
own internal versions of the events. With these, you can communicate through the following APIs:

### `events.get`

Returns a single event, based on the id that you pass to it as its single parameter.

### `events.getAll`

Returns all events that are currently in the calendar.

### `events.add`

Is called with one parameter: the new event to be added. The event must have a unique id.

### `events.update`

Updates an event that already exists in the calendar. Takes one parameter, which is the entire event you want to update.

### `events.remove`

Removes an event from the calendar. Takes one parameter, which is the id of the event you want to remove.

## Example

```ts
import { createCalendar } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ... other config
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      start: '2023-11-04 10:05',
      end: '2023-11-04 10:35',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Ski trip',
      start: '2023-12-04',
      end: '2023-12-06',
    },
  ],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))

calendar.events.get(1) // returns the event with id 1
calendar.events.getAll() // returns all events
calendar.events.add({
  id: 3,
  title: 'New event',
  start: '2023-12-04',
  end: '2023-12-06',
}) // adds a new event
calendar.events.update({
  id: 1,
  title: 'Updated event',
  start: '2023-12-04',
  end: '2023-12-06',
}) // updates the event with id 1
calendar.events.remove(1) // removes the event with id 1
```
