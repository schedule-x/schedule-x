## Other properties

Since you may want to add additional properties to your events, that carry meaning in the business logic of your
application, you are free to do so. The calendar will simply ignore the existence of them and return them back to
you upon interacting with the events.

## Event time

The timestamps of an event can have two different formats: `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`. These cannot be mixed
within the same event. For example:

1. **Timed events** - Events that have a start and end time such as:

```js
const timedEvent = {
  id: 1,
  start: '2025-10-01 20:15',
  end: '2025-10-01 21:15',
}
```

2. **Full day events** - Events that span the entire day such as:

```js
const fullDayEvent = {
  id: 2,
  start: '2025-10-01',
  end: '2025-10-01',
}
```

Both of these types have the possibility to be either a **single day event** or a **multi day event**.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  Though a planned future feature, the calendar does not yet support{' '}
  <b>time zones</b>. All times are assumed to be in the same time zone. If this
  feature is important to you, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub
  repository to help prioritize this feature.
</Callout>

## _options

Configure the behavior of individual events by adding an `_options` object to the event. All the following
properties are optional:

| Property          | Type       | Description                             | Default     |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| disableDND        | `boolean`  | Disables drag and drop for the event.   | `undefined` |
| disableResize     | `boolean`  | Disables resizing for the event.        | `undefined` |
| additionalClasses | `string[]` | Additional classes to add to the event. | `undefined` |


## Updating events

If you want to get, update or remove events after rendering the calendar, you need to use the [events service plugin](/docs/calendar/plugins/events-service).

## Example

```ts
import { createCalendar } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ... other config
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      start: '2023-11-04 10:05',
      end: '2023-11-04 10:35',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Ski trip',
      start: '2023-12-04',
      end: '2023-12-06',
    },
  ],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```
