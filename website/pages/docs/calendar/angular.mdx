# Angular component

This page offers documentation for using the Schedule-X calendar in Angular. For general documentation on
configuring the calendar, refer to the rest of the documentation. If you are using
Schedule-X in an app with SSR, you need to make sure the component only renders in the browser.

## Installing

```bash copy
npm install @schedule-x/angular @schedule-x/theme-default
```

If you're using a package manager that does not automatically
download peer dependencies, you will additionally need to install `@schedule-x/calendar`, `@preact/signals` and
`preact`. This is for example the case for **yarn** and **npm < v7**.

## Basic usage

### Example

```ts
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
import { CalendarComponent } from "@schedule-x/angular";
import { createCalendar, viewWeek } from "@schedule-x/calendar";
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/calendar.css'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RouterOutlet, CalendarComponent],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.css'
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'angular-example';
  calendarApp = createCalendar({
    events: [
      {
        id: '1',
        title: 'Event 1',
        start: '2024-06-11 03:00',
        end: '2024-06-11 05:00',
      },
    ],
    views: [viewWeek],
  })
}

```

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->

<main class="main">
  <div class="content">
    <sx-calendar [calendarApp]="calendarApp"></sx-calendar>
  </div>
</main>

<router-outlet />

```

### Explanation

#### The calendar instance

The `createCalendar` function takes a [configuration object](/docs/calendar/configuration) as its single argument,
and returns an instance of the calendar app. The calendar instance contains some methods that you can use to
interact with the calendar events and toggle between light and dark mode. For more on this, refer to the rest of the
calendar docs.

## Styles

The Schedule-X calendar is a responsive component. To achieve this,
it cannot be delivered with a fixed height or width of its own. You need to define the height and width of the
wrapping element `.ng-calendar-wrapper` according to your needs. For a regular desktop application, something
like this might do the trick for you:

```css
.ng-calendar-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 800px;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
```

## Custom content rendering

Though a project goal, the Angular component does not yet support customizing the content of events. If you need this
for your use case, please open an issue at GitHub.
