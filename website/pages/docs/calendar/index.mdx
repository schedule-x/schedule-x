# Getting Started

If you are using any of the following frameworks, you can start by checking out their respective setup guides:

import {Cards} from 'nextra/components'

<Cards num={3}>
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="React"
    href="/docs/frameworks/react"
  ></Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="Vue"
    href="/docs/frameworks/vue"
  ></Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="Angular"
    href="/docs/frameworks/angular"
  ></Cards.Card>
</Cards>

<Cards num={3}>
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="Svelte"
    href="/docs/frameworks/svelte"
  ></Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card
    arrow
    title="Preact"
    href="/docs/frameworks/preact"
  ></Cards.Card>
</Cards>



## 1. Install

We will start by downloading the calendar and its theme.

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/calendar @schedule-x/theme-default
```

## 2. Setup

After downloading and importing our dependencies, we can create an instance of the calendar using the
`createCalendar` function. This function takes one argument: its configuration object. It is then rendered
using the `render` method.

```ts
import { createCalendar, createViewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [createViewMonthGrid()],
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      start: '2023-12-04 10:05',
      end: '2023-12-04 10:35',
    },
  ],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```

### Configuration object

As a bare minimum, the configuration object needs two things:

1. A list of views. Currently available views are __month grid__,
   __week__, __day__ and __month agenda__.
2. A list of events.

### Style & theme

#### CSS of wrapping element

You will need to decide on the styles of the element wrapping the calendar. This will depend on
your use case. For many use cases, something like this should suffice:

```css
#calendar {
  width: 100%;
  height: 800px;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
```

#### Theme

The calendar renders to light mode by default. If you want, you can either override this default through configuration,
or set the theme programmatically:

```ts
const calendar = createCalendar(/***/)

calendar.setTheme('dark')
// or
calendar.setTheme('light')
```
