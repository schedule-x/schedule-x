# Getting Started

## 1. Install

We will start this tutorial by downloading the calendar and its styles. Please note, that using the
styles is completely optional, and you could theoretically create your own
theme. If doing so, however, please pin your dependency to a fixed version to avoid risking unwanted breaking changes.

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/calendar @schedule-x/theme-default
```

## 2. Setup

After downloading and importing our dependencies, we can now move on to create an instance of the calendar using the
`createCalendar` function. This function takes one argument, namely its configuration object. It is then rendered
using the `render` method. This method takes a DOM element, which the calendar is then rendered onto, as its argument.

```ts
import { createCalendar, viewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [viewMonthGrid],
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      start: '2023-12-04 10:05',
      end: '2023-12-04 10:35',
    },
  ],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```

### Configuration object

As a bare minimum, the configuration object needs two things:

1. A list of views. Currently available views are `viewMonthGrid`,
   `viewWeek`, `viewDay` and `viewMonthAgenda`.
2. A list of events.

### Style

You will need to decide on the styles of the element wrapping the calendar. This will be highly dependent on
your use case. For many use cases, however, something like the following should suffice:

```css
#calendar {
  width: 100%;
  height: 800px;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
```
