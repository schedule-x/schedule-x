# Getting Started

## 1. Install

We will start this tutorial by downloading the calendar and its styles. Please note, that using the
styles is completely optional, and you could theoretically create your own
theme. If doing so, however, please pin your dependency to a fixed version to avoid risking unwanted breaking changes.

```bash
npm i @schedule-x/calendar @schedule-x/theme-default
```

## 2. Code

After importing our dependencies, we can now move on to create an instance of the calendar using the
`createCalendar` function. This function takes one argument, namely its configuration object. It is then rendered
using the `render` method. This method takes a DOM element, which the calendar is then rendered onto, as its argument.

```ts
import { createCalendar, viewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [viewMonthGrid],
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      time: {
        start: '2023-12-04 10:05',
        end: '2023-12-04 10:35',
      },
    },
  ],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```

### Configuration object

As a bare minimum, the configuration object needs two things:

1. A list of views. Currently available views are `viewMonthGrid`,
   `viewWeek`, `viewDay` and `viewMonthAgenda`.
2. A list of events.

### Initialize the Calendar

Finally, we call the `bootstrap` method on the calendar. This will now
render the calendar in the DOM element we specified earlier.
