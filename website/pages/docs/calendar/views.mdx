# Calendar views

The views are the most basic building blocks of the calendar. There are
currently 4 views available, as listed below, but first:

## A note on screen sizes

The Schedule-X calendar is designed to be responsive. Given standard browser settings where 1rem = 16px, the
calendar has an internal break point of 700px: below this break point,
the calendar tries to display only views that are compatible with small
screens. Above this break point, the calendar tries to display only views
that are compatible with large screens.

If your users will view the calendar on small as well as large
screens, you need to include at least one view compatible with small screens and at least one view compatible with
large screens.

## The available views

| View name    | Large screens | Small screens |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Day          | Yes           | Yes           |
| Month grid   | Yes           | No            |
| Month agenda | No            | Yes           |
| Week         | Yes           | No            |

## An example using all views

```ts
import {
  createViewDay,
  createViewMonthAgenda,
  createViewMonthGrid,
  createViewWeek,
  createCalendar
} from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [createViewDay(), createViewMonthAgenda(), createViewMonthGrid(), createViewWeek()],
  events: [],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```
