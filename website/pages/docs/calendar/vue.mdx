# Vue component

This page offers documentation for the Vue-specific usage of the Schedule-X calendar. For general documentation on
configuring and interacting with the calendar, refer to the rest of the calendar documentation.

## Installing

```bash copy
npm install @schedule-x/vue @schedule-x/theme-default
```

This installs the Vue component and the default theme. If you're using a package manager that does not automatically
download peer dependencies, you will additionally need to install `@schedule-x/calendar`, `@preact/signals` and
`preact`. This is for example the case for **yarn** and **npm < v7**.

## Basic usage

### Example

```vue
<script setup>
import { ScheduleXCalendar } from '@schedule-x/vue'
import {
  createCalendar,
  viewDay,
  viewWeek,
  viewMonthGrid,
  viewMonthAgenda
} from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const calendarApp = createCalendar({
  selectedDate: '2023-12-19',
  views: [viewDay, viewWeek, viewMonthGrid, viewMonthAgenda],
  defaultView: viewWeek.name,
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Event 1',
      start: '2023-12-19',
      end: '2023-12-19',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Event 2',
      start: '2023-12-20 12:00',
      end: '2023-12-20 13:00',
    },
  ],
})

</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <ScheduleXCalendar
      :calendar-app="calendarApp"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

### Explanation

#### Dependencies

From `@schedule-x/vue` you need to import the `ScheduleXCalendar` component. From `@schedule-x/calendar` you need to
import the views you want to use and the `createCalendar` function. Lastly, from `@schedule-x/theme-default` you
import the default theme.

#### The calendar instance

The `createCalendar` function takes a [configuration object](/docs/calendar/configuration) as its single argument,
and returns an instance of the calendar app. The calendar instance contains some methods that you can use to
interact with the calendar events and toggle between light and dark mode. For more on this, refer to the rest of the
calendar docs.

#### The component

The `ScheduleXCalendar` component then takes the calendar instance as a prop `calendar-app` and renders the calendar
for you. This means you should not call the `render` method of the calendar instance yourself, as shown in other
examples in the docs.

## Custom components

The Schedule-X calendar is built with customization in mind. Currently, you can use the following two custom
components to write your own Vue components for parts of the calendar:

| Component name  | Description                                                      | Props           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `timeGridEvent` | The component for timed events used in the week- and day views   | `calendarEvent` |
| `dateGridEvent` | The component for all-day events used in the week- and day views | `calendarEvent` |

An example of how to use these components can be found here: https://github.com/schedule-x/vue-example/blob/main/src/App.vue
