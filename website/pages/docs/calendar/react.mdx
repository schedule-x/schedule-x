# React component

This page offers documentation for the React-specific usage of the Schedule-X calendar. For general documentation on
configuring and interacting with the calendar, refer to the rest of the calendar documentation.

## Installing

```bash copy
npm install @schedule-x/react @schedule-x/theme-default
```

This installs the React component and the default theme. If you're using a package manager that does not automatically
download peer dependencies, you will additionally need to install `@schedule-x/calendar`, `@preact/signals` and
`preact`. This is for example the case for **yarn** and **npm < v7**.

## Basic usage

### Example

```jsx
import { useCalendarApp, Calendar } from '@schedule-x/react'
import {
  viewWeek,
  viewDay,
  viewMonthGrid,
  viewMonthAgenda,
} from '@schedule-x/calendar'

import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

function CalendarApp() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    defaultView: viewMonthGrid.name,
    views: [viewDay, viewWeek, viewMonthGrid, viewMonthAgenda],
    events: [
      {
        id: '1',
        title: 'Event 1',
        start: '2023-12-16',
        end: '2023-12-16',
      },
    ],
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <Calendar calendarApp={calendar} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default CalendarApp
```

### Explanation

#### Dependencies

From `@schedule-x/react` you need to import the `Calendar` component and the `useCalendarApp` hook. From
`@schedule-x/calendar` you need to import the views you want to use. This example uses all the
available default views. Lastly, from `@schedule-x/theme-default` you import the default theme.

#### Calendar app

The `useCalendarApp` takes a [configuration object](/docs/calendar/configuration) as its single argument, and returns an
instance of the calendar app. This instance contains some methods that you can use to interact with
the calendar events and toggle between light and dark mode. For more on this, refer to the rest of the calendar docs
which to a large extent also applies to the React component.

#### Calendar component

After configuring the calendar instance to your liking, you can pass it to the `Calendar` component as a prop. The
component will then take care of rendering the calendar and all its views, meaning you should not call the `render`
method on your own, as documented in other parts of this site.

## Styles

The Schedule-X calendar is a responsive component which aims to fit many screen sizes and use cases. To achieve this,
it cannot be delivered with a fixed height or width of its own. You need to define the height and width of the
wrapping element `.sx-react-calendar-wrapper` according to your needs. For a regular desktop application, something
like this might do the trick for you:

```css
.sx-react-calendar-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 800px;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
```

## Custom components

The Schedule-X calendar is built with customization in mind. Currently, you can use the following two custom
components to write your own React components for parts of the calendar:

| Component name     | Description                                                      | Props                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `timeGridEvent`    | The component for timed events used in the week- and day views   | `calendarEvent`                 |
| `dateGridEvent`    | The component for all-day events used in the week- and day views | `calendarEvent`                 |
| `monthGridEvent`   | The component for events used in the month grid view             | `calendarEvent`, `hasStartDate` |
| `monthAgendaEvent` | The component for events used in the month agenda view           | `calendarEvent`                 |

An example of how to use these components can be found here: https://github.com/schedule-x/react-example/blob/main/src/App.tsx
