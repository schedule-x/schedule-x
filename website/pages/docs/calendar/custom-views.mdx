# Custom views

The Schedule-X calendar can be extended endlessly. You are not limited to using the default views offered by this
library; you can create your own views and plug them into the calendar. Currently, you can only build a custom view
using Preact, the virtual DOM library used by Schedule-X, but the ambition is to extend this to enable building custom
views in React and Vue.

## Building a custom view with Preact

The easiest way to get started building a custom view is to clone the [extension builder repo](https://github.com/schedule-x/extension-builder).
