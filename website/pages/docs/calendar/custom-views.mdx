# Custom views

The Schedule-X calendar can be extended endlessly. You are not limited to using the default views offered by this
library; you can create your own views and plug them into the calendar. Currently, you can only build a custom view
using Preact, the virtual DOM library used by Schedule-X, but the plan is to extend this to enable building custom
views in React and Vue.

## Building a custom view with Preact

First of all, you do not need to download Preact on top of Schedule-X. When you downloaded Schedule-X, you
already
received Preact as a peer dependency.

You create a custom view by calling the `createPreactView` function from the `@schedule-x/calendar` package. This
function takes a single argument, a ViewConfig object which is for now only documented here: https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x/blob/main/packages/shared/src/types/calendar/view.ts

For an example of how a view is put together, you can look at the source code of the default views in the
`@schedule-x/calendar` package, for example: https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x/blob/main/packages/calendar/src/views/month-grid/index.ts
