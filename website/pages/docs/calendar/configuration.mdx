# Calendar configuration

This page describes a few of the config-options available. Some options, however, require more
in-depth understanding and are therefore documented in separate pages.

## Options in the calendar config

```ts
import { createCalendar, viewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const config = {
  // ... views, events and other options
