# Calendar configuration

This page describes a few of the options available for configuring the calendar. Some options, however, require more
in-depth understanding and are therefore documented in separate pages.

## Options in the calendar config

```ts
import { createCalendar, viewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const config = {
  // ... views, events and other options

  /**
  * Set the language. Currently supports: 'en-US', 'en-GB', 'de-DE', 'zh-CN' and 'sv-SE'
  * For support of further languages, please open a PR, adding your translations under the folder:
  * packages/translations/src/locales/xx-XX
  *
  * Defaults to 'en-US'
  * */
  locale: 'zh-CN',

  /**
  * Set which day is to be considered the starting day of the week. 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, (...other days) 6 = Saturday
  * Defaults to 1 (Monday)
  * */
  firstDayOfWeek: 0,

  /**
  * The preferred view to display when the calendar is first rendered.
  * all views that you import have a "name" property, which helps you identify them.
  * Defaults to the first view in the "views" array
  * */
  defaultView: viewMonthGrid.name,

  /**
  * The default date to display when the calendar is first rendered. Only accepts YYYY-MM-DD format.
  * Defaults to the current date
  * */
  selectedDate: '2023-12-24',

  /**
  * Render the calendar in dark mode.
  * Defaults to false
  * */
  isDark: true,

  /**
  * Callbacks for events that occur in the calendar
  * */
  callbacks: {
    /**
    * Is called when:
    * 1. Selecting a date in the date picker
    * 2. Selecting a new view
    * */
    onRangeUpdate(range) {
      console.log('new calendar range start date', range.start)
      console.log('new calendar range end date', range.end)
    },

    /**
    * Is called when an event is updated through drag and drop
    * */
    onEventUpdate(updatedEvent) {
      console.log('onEventUpdate', updatedEvent)
    },
  }
}

const calendar = createCalendar(config)

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```
