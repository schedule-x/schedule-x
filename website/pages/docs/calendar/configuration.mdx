# Calendar configuration

This page describes a few of the options available for configuring the calendar. Some options, however, require more
in-depth understanding and are therefore documented in separate pages.

## Options in the calendar config

```ts
import { createCalendar, viewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const config = {
  // ... views, events and other options

  /**
   * Set the language. Currently supports: 'en-US', 'it-IT', 'en-GB', 'de-DE', 'zh-CN', ja-JP, ru-RU and 'sv-SE'
   * For support of further languages, please open a PR, adding your translations under the folder:
   * packages/translations/src/locales/xx-XX
   *
   * Defaults to 'en-US'
   * */
  locale: 'zh-CN',

  /**
   * Set which day is to be considered the starting day of the week. 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, (...other days) 6 = Saturday
   * Defaults to 1 (Monday)
   * */
  firstDayOfWeek: 0,

  /**
   * The preferred view to display when the calendar is first rendered.
   * all views that you import have a "name" property, which helps you identify them.
   * Defaults to the first view in the "views" array
   * */
  defaultView: viewMonthGrid.name,

  /**
   * The default date to display when the calendar is first rendered. Only accepts YYYY-MM-DD format.
   * Defaults to the current date
   * */
  selectedDate: '2023-12-24',

  /**
   * Render the calendar in dark mode.
   * Defaults to false
   * */
  isDark: true,

  /**
  * Decides which hours should be displayed in the week and day grids. Defaults to midnight - midnight (a full day)
  * Can also be set to a "hybrid" day, such as { start: '06:00', end: '03:00' }, meaning each day starts at 6am but
  * extends into the next day until 3am.
  * */
  dayBoundaries: {
    start: '06:00',
    end: '18:00',
  },

  /**
   * Callbacks for events that occur in the calendar
   * */
  callbacks: {
    /**
     * Is called when:
     * 1. Selecting a date in the date picker
     * 2. Selecting a new view
     * */
    onRangeUpdate(range) {
      console.log('new calendar range start date', range.start)
      console.log('new calendar range end date', range.end)
    },

    /**
     * Is called when an event is updated through drag and drop
     * */
    onEventUpdate(updatedEvent) {
      console.log('onEventUpdate', updatedEvent)
    },

    /**
    * Is called when an event is clicked
    * */
    onEventClick(calendarEvent) {
      console.log('onEventClick', calendarEvent)
    },

    /**
    * Is called when clicking a date in the month grid
    * */
    onClickDate(date) {
      console.log('onClickDate', date) // e.g. 2024-01-01
    },

    /**
    * Is called when clicking somewhere in the time grid of a week or day view
    * */
    onClickDateTime(dateTime) {
      console.log('onClickDateTime', dateTime) // e.g. 2024-01-01 12:37
    }
  },
}

const calendar = createCalendar(config)

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```
