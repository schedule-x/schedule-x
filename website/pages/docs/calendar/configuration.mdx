# Calendar configuration

This page describes a few of the config-options available. Some options, however, require more
in-depth understanding and are therefore documented in separate pages.

## Options in the calendar config

```ts
import { createCalendar, viewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const config = {
  // ... views, events and other options

  /**
   * Set the language. List of supported languages: https://schedule-x.dev/docs/calendar/supported-languages
   * For support of further languages, please open a PR, adding your translations under the folder:
   * packages/translations/src/locales/xx-XX
   *
   * Defaults to 'en-US'
   * */
  locale: 'zh-CN',

  /**
   * Set which day is to be considered the starting day of the week. 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, (...other days) 6 = Saturday
   * Defaults to 1 (Monday)
   * */

  /**
   * The preferred view to display when the calendar is first rendered.
   * all views that you import have a "name" property, which helps you identify them.
   * Defaults to the first view in the "views" array

   * The default date to display when the calendar is first rendered. Only accepts YYYY-MM-DD format.
