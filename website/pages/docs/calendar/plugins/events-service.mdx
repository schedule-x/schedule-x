# Events Service Plugin

This plugin provides APIs to add, update and remove events.

## Install

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/events-service
```

## Methods

### `get(id)`

Returns a single event, based on the id that you pass to it as its single parameter.

### `getAll()`

Returns all events that are currently in the calendar.

### `add(event)`

Is called with one parameter: the new event to be added. The event must have a unique id.

### `update(event)`

Updates an event that already exists in the calendar. Takes one parameter, which is the entire event you want to update.

### `remove(id)`

Removes an event from the calendar. Takes one parameter, which is the id of the event you want to remove.

### `set(events)`

Sets all events in the calendar. This will override all existing events in the calendar with the new ones you pass to it.

## Example

```js
import { createEventsServicePlugin } from '@schedule-x/events-service'

const eventsServicePlugin = createEventsServicePlugin();const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [eventsServicePlugin],
})
calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))

eventsServicePlugin.add({
  title: 'Event 1',
  start: '2024-04-20',
  end: '2024-04-20',
  id: 1
})

eventsServicePlugin.get(1) // { title: 'Event 1', start: '2024-04-20', end: '2024-04-20', id: 1 }

eventsServicePlugin.getAll() // [{ title: 'Event 1', start: '2024-04-20', end: '2024-04-20', id: 1 }]

eventsServicePlugin.update({
  title: 'Real title',
  start: '2024-04-20',
  end: '2024-04-20',
  id: 1
})

eventsServicePlugin.remove(1)
```
