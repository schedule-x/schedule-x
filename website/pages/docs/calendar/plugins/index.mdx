# Plugins

The calendar can be extended with additional features through plugins. The library offers a range of plugins that can be downloaded separately.
You can also write your own custom plugins.

## Basic example

You can add plugins to the calendar, by passing them as the second argument to `createCalendar`.

```ts
import { createCalendar, createViewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import { createDragAndDropPlugin } from '@schedule-x/drag-and-drop'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'

const plugins = [
  createDragAndDropPlugin(),
]

const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [createViewMonthGrid()],
  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      start: '2023-12-04 10:05',
      end: '2023-12-04 10:35',
    },
  ],
}, plugins)

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```
