# Resize

Resize events in the time grid by dragging their bottom edge, and fullday/multiple-day events by dragging their right
edge. Month view support is planned as a minor release during the 1.x.x release cycle.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡" title="Note">
  Though this plugin should technically work also when using custom components in Vue or React, it might look a bit
  ugly because it forces each custom event to rerender on every resize. This is planned to be fixed with v2.0.0
</Callout>

## Install

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/resize
```

## Usage

```js
import { createResizePlugin } from '@schedule-x/resize'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [createResizePlugin()],
})
```

## Configuration

You can configure the length, in minutes, of the intervals that are used when resizing:

```js
import { createResizePlugin } from '@schedule-x/resize'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  // ...other configuration
  plugins: [createResizePlugin(30)], // 30 minute intervals when resizing
})
```

Available values are `15` (default), `30` and `60`
