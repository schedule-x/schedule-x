# Community plugins

Sharing is caring, right? If you are one of those awesome people that have built a plugin and would
like to share it with the community, please let us know by creating an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x).

Here follows a not yet so long, but someday hopefully longer, list of community plugins for the Schedule-X.

## List of plugins

- [CopyEventPlugin](https://github.com/starredev/schedule-x-plugins) by [Bryan van der Starre](https://github.com/starredev): A plugin that allows you to copy/paste events.

- [ZoomInPlugin](https://github.com/starredev/schedule-x-plugins) by [Bryan van der Starre](https://github.com/starredev): A plugin that allows you to zoom in on the calendar grid.
