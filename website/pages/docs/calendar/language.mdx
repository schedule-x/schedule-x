## Customizing the translations

To customize translations, you can use the `mergeLocales` helper to merge the original translations
with your custom translations. This way, you can override the default translations with your own.

Below is an example of how to customize the `Week` translation for the `en-US` locale, which could be useful if
you configure the number of days shown in a week.

```ts
import { translations, mergeLocales } from '@schedule-x/translations'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  translations: mergeLocales(
    translations,
    {
      enUS: {
        'Week': '4 days'
      }
    }
  ),
  // ... other config options
})
```
