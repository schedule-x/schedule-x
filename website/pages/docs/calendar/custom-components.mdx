# Visual overview of custom components

Below follows a few images, to help visualize the parts of a calendar that can be
replaced by custom components.

Please note, that only the React and Vue adapters will at all times have 100% support for
all custom components. This is due to the way custom components are implemented. While in Vue and React
custom components can be passed 100% dynamically, the Angular and Svelte components require a bit of
hard-coding for every new custom component. If you are missing some custom component in Angular or Svelte,
please open an issue or PR.
