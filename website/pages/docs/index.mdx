# Welcome to Schedule-X


## Mission
The world largely stays organized through calendars. We open them in the morning at work, to get a grasp of what's
awaiting us for the day. We open them on our phones when our friends ask us if we're free next weekend. We open
them when trying to find the optimal vacation week, in order to not miss any important events.

Schedule-X aims to fill a gap in the space of web calendars, offering scheduling components that meet **all the most
common needs** of web apps, such as responsiveness, accessibility, dark- and light modes and flexibility.
