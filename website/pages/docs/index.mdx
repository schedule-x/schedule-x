# Welcome to Schedule-X

## Mission

The world largely stays organized through calendars. We open them in the morning at work on our laptop, to get a
grasp of what's awaiting us for the day. We open them on our phones when our friends ask us if we're free next
weekend. If our eyes are tired, we might want to switch to dark mode.

Schedule-X aims to fill a gap in the space of web calendars, offering scheduling components that meet **all the most
common needs** of web apps, such as responsiveness, accessibility, dark- and light modes and being intuitive.
Schedule-X tries to achieve all of this through being very petty about performance, small details, and through
leaning heavily on Google's [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).
