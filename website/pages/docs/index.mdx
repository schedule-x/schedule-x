# Welcome to Schedule-X

## Mission

Building a calendar is not a small endeavor. It takes a lot of work to get it right, and most of us don't have the
privilege of spending a year building an event calendar. Even if you get the basics right, then what about dark mode,
accessibility, and responsiveness?

Schedule-X aims to fill a gap in the space of web calendars, offering scheduling components that meet **all the most
common needs** of web apps, such as responsiveness, accessibility, dark- and light modes and being intuitive.
Schedule-X tries to achieve all of this through being very petty about performance, small details, and through
leaning heavily on Google's [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).
