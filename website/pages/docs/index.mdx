# Welcome to Schedule-X

Schedule-X is a library of scheduling components for the web. It is built on top of the virtual DOM implementation
of Preact, in order to remain lightweight and framework-agnostic. This means
that you can use its calendar and date picker in React, Vue,
Angular, or any other web application framework.

  change. If you use it, consider pinning your dependency to a specific version
  until v1.0.0 is released.
