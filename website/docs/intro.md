# Tutorial Intro

This library aims to offer material design scheduling components for web frontends. The components of this library are
framework-agnostic, meaning you can use them in any application, regardless of which framework or modern build tools you
might use.

:::info

This library is still in a pre-release state. While it is usable, its API might still change greatly.
If you use it, consider pinning your dependency to a specific version.
