# Schedule-X v3: Embracing the Future with Temporal API

Schedule-X v3 is here, and brings about some big changes to the library. Most significantly, the library moves away from its own custom, floating date- and time format, to using [`Temporal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal).

This is an exciting development, because `Temporal` is just starting to land in browsers, and is likely to become the new standard for handling date and time in JavaScript.

## A peek at the new API

Starting from v3, a calendar can be installed like so:

```bash copy
npm i @schedule-x/calendar @schedule-x/theme-default temporal-polyfill
```

Note, that the `temporal-polyfill` is not required if you know that your users are all in an environment that already supports `Temporal`.

You can then set up a timezone-aware calendar, displaying all events according to London time, like so:

```ts
import { createCalendar, createViewMonthGrid } from '@schedule-x/calendar'
import '@schedule-x/theme-default/dist/index.css'
import 'temporal-polyfill/global'

const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [createViewMonthGrid()],
  
  timezone: 'Europe/London',

  events: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Coffee with John',
      start: Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2023-12-04T10:05:00+01:00[Europe/Berlin]'),
      end: Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2023-12-04T10:35:00+01:00[Europe/Berlin]'),
    },

    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Meeting with Jane',
      start: Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2023-12-04T18:05:00+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]'),
      end: Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2023-12-04T18:35:00+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]'),
    },
  ],
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```

Which will then result in the following:

## `Temporal.PlainDate`

Going forward, the library also supports the use of `Temporal.PlainDate`. Picture the use case, that you're building a calendar for a global company, where in all countries employees have a day off for New Years Eve and Day.

Using timezone aware events for this, would quickly get quite cumbersome, since now you would need to have events starting at midnight in every timezone.

With `Temporal.PlainDate`, you can simply set an event to occur on December 31st every year, and the calendar will take care of the rest.

```ts
const newYears = {
    id: 3,
    title: 'Holidays',
    start: Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year: 2025, month: 12, day: 31 }),
    end: Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year: 2026, month: 1, day: 1 }),
}
```

## Non-Gregorian calendars

Another huge perk of the new API, is that it will enable Schedule-X to better support use of non-Gregorian calendars. This is not yet supported, but is planned for release during the lifespan of v3.

The idea is that you should be able to set up a calendar like so:

```ts
const calendar = createCalendar({
  views: [createViewMonthGrid()],

  locale: 'zh-CN',
  
  timezone: 'Asia/Shanghai',

  calendarSystem: 'chinese',
})

calendar.render(document.getElementById('calendar'))
```

And with that, display an entirely Chinese calendar.

## Some words on the `temporal-polyfill`

This was a huge leap forward for Schedule-X. Admittedly, having to add new dependencies, like the `temporal-polyfill`, might seem like an odd choice to some people. Why not wait for `Temporal` to have landed in all browsers?

Well, the simple answer is that Schedule-X aims to be a **modern solution to scheduling**, and migrating to a new standard like Temporal seemed like a no-brainer. If we wanted to wait for `Temporal` to have landed in enough browsers and user thus user devices, we would be waiting for multiple years. 

Additionally, `temporal-polyfill` is developed and maintained by [Adam Shaw](https://arshaw.com/), the creator of FullCalendar, who has quite the track record in shipping open source software. So the added dependency seemed like a pretty great, and reliable, trade-off, for being able to migrate to Temporal.
