# Schedule-X v4: What's New

Schedule-X v4 is the next major step for the project, and with it comes an important update to Schedule-X Premium and how the free vs premium split will work going forward.

## New in v4: Time Grid Resource View (Premium)

In v4, we’re releasing a **Time Grid Resource View** — a long-requested view that combines resource scheduling with a time grid layout.

This view will be part of **Schedule-X Premium**.

## Drag-and-drop and resize are moving to Premium

Starting with v4, the following packages will **no longer be supported in the open source (free) version** of Schedule-X and are moving to **Schedule-X Premium**:

- `@schedule-x/drag-and-drop` → `@sx-premium/drag-and-drop`
- `@schedule-x/resize` → `@sx-premium/resize`

I understand that this change can put stress on teams using Schedule-X for free, and I’m genuinely sorry for the inconvenience.

## Why we’re making this change

Schedule-X is a small business, and we have to find viable ways to run it and generate revenue — so that Schedule-X doesn’t become another piece of abandonware in the vast ocean of abandoned open source projects.

The goal here is to keep the free version strong and useful, while making Premium sustainable enough to fund ongoing development, support, and long-term maintenance.

## The free vs premium split, going forward

From now on, the free vs premium divide in the project will mainly be:

- **Displaying scheduling info**
- **Interacting with it and modifying it**

In practice, the larger part of functionality that is primarily used for **displaying** information will be free. Any of the more complex views and plugins for **interaction** (dragging, resizing, editing flows, advanced schedulers) will be part of Premium.

## A thank-you (and a discount for contributors)
