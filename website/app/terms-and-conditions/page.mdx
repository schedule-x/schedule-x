# Terms and conditions for Schedule-X premium

Last updated: April 5, 2025

Welcome, and thank you for choosing Schedule-X Premium. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use
of Schedule-X Premium ("the Software"), a product offered and licensed by **Tom Ã–sterlund, Schedule-X** ("we", "our",
or "us").
By accessing, installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. Licensing Options
You may purchase a license to Schedule-X Premium through one of our authorized sales channels, including but not limited to Lemon Squeezy.

We offer two types of licenses:

1) Lifetime License: One-time payment per team, includes 1 year of software updates and support. Continued access to updates and support after this period requires you to get a yearly license.

2) Yearly Subscription: Recurring annual payment per team, includes ongoing software updates and support for as long as the subscription remains active.

## 2. Seat-Based Licensing (per software project)
Licenses are sold on a per-project basis. The price depends on the total number of software developers in your project team where Schedule-X Premium is being used.

It does not matter how many developers are directly integrating Schedule-X â€” the overall team size is what counts.

If we have reasonable doubt that the incorrect license tier has been selected, we reserve the right to inquire about your team size.

We will always approach such matters respectfully and will typically accept your explanation once provided.

However, if such an inquiry is ignored or left unresolved, we reserve the right to revoke access to the Software.

## 3. Usage Rights
Upon purchase, you receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Schedule-X Premium in accordance with these Terms.

You are permitted to:

* Integrate the Software into your applications, products, or internal tools. The bundled software can also be included in your own publicly available JavaScript bundles. Minifying the output is encouraged in such cases, but not required.

* Use the Software within your licensed team size.

* Use the Software for **one** project. If you are using the Software in multiple projects, be it internal or for external customers, you need one license per software project. Multi-tenant applications, or SaaS solutions that can be hosted on multiple instances are considered one project: in such cases you only need one license.

You are not permitted to:

* Sell, share, or distribute the source code of the Software, as a product in itself. If your product is another JavaScript library which needs to be publicly available,
please contact us for a special license.

* Make the Software or its code available in any way that enables others to use it without purchasing their own license.

* Use the Software to create a competing event calendar JavaScript library.

## 4. Feature Requests and Roadmap
Licensing the Software does not entitle you to:

* Demand that specific features be built.

* Dictate development priorities or timelines.

You are purchasing access to the Software as-is, along with updates as defined by your license type.

## 5. Enforcement and Termination
We reserve the right to suspend or revoke your license if:

You misrepresent your team size or violate the licensing terms.

You fail to respond to a reasonable license verification inquiry.

You distribute or misuse the Software in violation of these Terms.

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we do, we'll notify you via email (if you're an active customer) or by posting the updated Terms on our website.

## 6. Other Terms

We may present logos of customers on our website, for marketing purposes and building trust with the developer community. If you do not want your logo to be displayed, please send us an email to let us know.
