# Visual overview of custom components

Below follow a few images, to help visualize the parts of a calendar that can be
replaced by custom components.

Please note that only the React, Vue and Svelte adapters will at all times have 100% support for
all custom components. This is due to the way custom components are implemented. While in Vue, React and Svelte
custom components can be passed 100% dynamically, the Angular components require a bit of
hard-coding for every new custom component. If you are missing some custom component in Angular,
please open an issue or PR.
