# Cursor Rules

## Test Running
When the user asks to "run a test", "run tests", "test this file", or similar test-related requests, automatically execute the following command:

```bash
npx vitest {relative_file_path}
```

Where `{relative_file_path}` should be replaced with the actual relative path to the current file being tested.

For example:
- If the user is in a file at `packages/my-package/src/component.test.ts`, run: `npx vitest packages/my-package/src/component.test.ts`
- If the user is in a file at `libs/utils/helpers.spec.ts`, run: `npx vitest libs/utils/helpers.spec.ts`

This rule applies to any file with test-related extensions like `.test.ts`, `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, `.spec.js`, etc.
