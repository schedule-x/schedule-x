Thank you for wanting to take the time to report a problem. In order to increase the chances of the issue being 
resolved, please take a moment to give as much relevant information as possible.

**Minimal reproduction environment**

Please take a moment to set up a reproduction example. Bug reports without a reproduction example will be closed. 
Many times people find solutions to their problems while setting such examples up. And when there is an actual bug, 
these examples help a lot for whoever ends up fixing it. For open sourced features, you can use 
these templates:

- [Vue](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/schedule-x-repro-starter---vue-zct3p6)
- [React](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/schedule-x-repro-starter---react-zvy4y3)

For premium features, please fork one of the following repositories, add your credentials in `.npmrc` locally, and then 
push the changes to your own repository. Here it is VERY important that you don't push your credentials, since this 
will force us to invalidate your token if discovered. Repos to fork:

- [Vue](https://github.com/schedule-x/vue-examples)
- [React](https://github.com/schedule-x/react-examples)
- [Angular](https://github.com/schedule-x/angular-examples)
- [Svelte](https://github.com/schedule-x/svelte-examples)

Before posting your report, you can remove all the instructions above and just leave a link to your reproduction example.
