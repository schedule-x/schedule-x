# <ReactIcon /> React component

This page offers documentation for using the Schedule-X calendar in React. For general documentation on
configuring and interacting with the calendar, refer to the rest of the calendar documentation.

## Installing

In this example we will set up a calendar with the default theme, and a plugin for retrieving and updating events.

```bash copy
npm install @schedule-x/react @schedule-x/theme-default @schedule-x/events-service
```

If you're using a package manager that does not automatically
download peer dependencies, you will additionally need to install `@schedule-x/calendar`, `@preact/signals` and
`preact`. This is for example the case for **yarn** and **npm < v7**.

## Basic usage

### Example

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'
import ReactExample from '../../../../components/code-examples/react-calendar.mdx'
import NextjsExample from '../../../../components/code-examples/nextjs-calendar.mdx'
import {Callout} from "nextra/components";

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <ReactExample />
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Callout type="info">
      Depending on your build tools, you might need to target
      the ESM file from `@schedule-x/react` explicitly:

      ```js copy
      import { ScheduleXCalendar, useNextCalendarApp } from '@schedule-x/react/dist/index'
      ```

    </Callout>
    <NextjsExample />
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Styles

The Schedule-X calendar is a responsive component. To achieve this,
it cannot be delivered with a fixed height or width of its own. You need to define the height and width of the
wrapping element `.sx-react-calendar-wrapper` according to your needs. For a regular desktop application, something
like this might do the trick for you:

```css
.sx-react-calendar-wrapper {
  width: 1200px;
  max-width: 100vw;
  height: 800px;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
```

## Custom components

The Schedule-X calendar is built with customization in mind. Currently, you can use the following custom
components to take control over certain parts of the calendar. This is done by writing your own React components:

| Slot / Component name       | Description                                                         | Props                           |
